## Code Explanation

**HTML(`index.html`)**
- The calculator is structured using a `div` with the ID `calculator`.
- Buttons are organized into rows for numbers, operators, and special functions like "C" and "=".

**CSS (`style.css`)**
- The calculator is styled with a dark theme for a modern look.
- Buttons have hover and active states for better user interaction.
- The display area is designed to show numbers clearly with right-aligned text.

**JavaScript (`script.js`)**
- Event listeners are used to detect button clicks.
- Functions like `number()`, `calculate()`, and `operate()` handle the logic for input, calculations, and displaying results.
- The calculator supports chaining operations (e.g., `5 + 3 - 2`).
